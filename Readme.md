File Upload and Summarization Application
Overview
This project consists of a full-stack application that allows users to upload documents (PDF, DOCX, TXT) and get summaries of their contents. It includes a backend service built with Flask/FastAPI and a frontend application developed with React.

Submission Requirements
Backend (Python)
Tasks:

Set up a basic Flask or FastAPI application.
Implement file handling and storage.
Integrate a pre-trained LLM (e.g., GPT-2 or a smaller model suitable for local deployment).
Implement a /upload endpoint to handle file uploads (PDF, DOCX, TXT).
Implement a /summarize endpoint to process and summarize the document using the locally hosted LLM.
Ensure the backend can handle multiple concurrent requests.
Evaluation Criteria:

Code quality and structure.
Correct implementation of endpoints.
Handling of file uploads and errors.
Efficiency and performance of the summarization process.
Frontend (React)
Tasks:

Set up a React application using Create React App or a similar tool.
Create a form for file uploads.
Implement API calls to the backend for file upload and summarization.
Display the uploaded fileâ€™s content.
Display the summarized text in a user-friendly manner.
Evaluation Criteria:

Code quality and structure.
User interface design and responsiveness.
Correct implementation of API calls.
Error handling and user feedback.
LLM Deployment
Tasks:

Set up a local environment for the LLM (use Docker if possible).
Load the pre-trained model and ensure it can generate text summaries.
Integrate the model with the backend to handle summarization requests.
Evaluation Criteria:

Correct deployment and integration of the LLM.
Performance and efficiency of the model.
Quality of the generated summaries.
Setup Instructions
Backend Setup
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone <repository-url>
cd backend
Create a Virtual Environment:

bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
Install Dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Backend Server:

bash
Copy code
python app.py
Frontend Setup
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone <repository-url>
cd frontend
Install Dependencies:

Docker Compose (Optional)
A docker-compose.yml file is provided for easier local deployment of the backend, frontend, and LLM services. To use it:

Navigate to the Project Root Directory:

bash
Copy code
cd project-root
Run Docker Compose:

bash
Copy code
docker-compose up
Approach and Challenges
Approach
Backend:

Developed using Flask/FastAPI.
Integrated file handling and a pre-trained LLM for summarization.
Frontend:

Created with React.
Implemented file upload and API interaction for file processing and summarization.
LLM Deployment:

Deployed a pre-trained LLM locally using Docker.
Challenges and Solutions
Handling Concurrent Requests: Implemented asynchronous processing in the backend.
Model Integration: Configured the LLM to work efficiently with the backend service.
File Upload and Processing: Ensured robust file handling and error management.
